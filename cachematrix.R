## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 


## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can 
## cache its inverse. The cache matrix has 4 methods set, get, setInverse, getInverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    i <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      i <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setInverse <- function(solve) i <<- solve
    getInverse <- function() i
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setInverse = setInverse,
         getInverse = getInverse)

}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
    i <- x$getInverse()
    if(!is.null(i)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(i)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    i <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setInverse(i)
    i
  
}
